Just rolling my own byte level Huffman encoder in C

Currently does not write the output; mostly just interested
in seeing how much entropy there is in everyday files.

Maybe I will add a byte output and a decode someday, but 
it was toy to better visualize various impact of various levels of Huffman. 

TODO: what is the best/fastest way to do bitpacking; need to do that to implement file output. 

USE:
make && ./Huffman <file>
